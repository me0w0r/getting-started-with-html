    There are five ways of thinking like a programmer. Procedural thinking which is making and followiwng steps top get to get to a solution. Abstract thinking which is understanding its overall abstract idea. Systematic debugging is using a systematic ways of solving the problems like first find out what the problem is which will lead to making up theories of why there a problem, then you test your theories and finally fix the problem.

In the first unit we discuss the basics of the web and how they work together. The web is made up of HTMLs which is the main document. Then there's the URLs which is how you refer to that html doc on the web. Http is a protocol that runs the html and url on the web. And the final result will be the web application of how all of these elements come together. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Langauge and the basic doc. Hyperlink are what glues those pages together. 
<br><br>
The web works by having you access it though your pc and the browser thats open in it. The browser then makes the request through a protocol called http via the internet to communicate to the server which will then respond with files and docs to show up on your browser(which can be IE, Chrome, Firefox).
<br><br>
HTML is made up of text content of what you'll actually see and how it looks like, can also reference other types of docs like images and videos. As well as having links to other pages. HTML markup is made up of tags such as (<)b(>) to make it a bold font or (<)em(>) to make it italic. <b>(***Obviously had to put quotes around < or > to make the tags show up but I know they don't belong***)</b> You make the line by having an (<)tag name(>)content (<(/)closing tag(>). Also made up og HTML attributes which will show up as (<)tag attr="value">content (<)/close atrribute(>). One attribute is the anchor tag expressed using a and /a. The line would be (<)a href="url"(>)content on what shows up(<)/a(>). Another atrribute is the image tag (<)img(>) which basically includes an image. (<)img src="url" alt="text"(>). The alt for alternate will show up as text when the img url doesn't work. The image tag does not have any closing tag.

As you type your code there will be whitespace from new lines spaces or tabs. Meaning even if you enter your text, it will continue to remain as one line of text. Tp fix that whitespace problem, you add in a break or(<)br(>) which will then force the html doc to make lines. The break tag is also a void tag so no need to make a closing tag. Another way to fix whitespace is the paragraph tag (<)p(>). There is a difference in the way these two act. The break tag is inline while p tag is a block. Inline means that where ever you put the tag its means to end there and put the rest of the text on the next line. Other examples of inline is (<)b(>), (<)em(>), (<)img(>), (<)a(>), and (<)span(>). Block actually puts the text into an inviable block where there is height and width and can be changed. Block examples is (<)div(>), (<)p(>), and (<)form(>).  

Finally the last thing mentioned was the actual html doc. It starts with what kind of doc it is (<)!DOCTYPE HTML(>). Next you have (<)html(>) to start your html doc. Next is the (<)head(>) which is metadata and also where you'd put javascript and css to stylize it (also needs the be closed). Then (<)title(>) (and its closing tag) is basically what will appear in the browser tab. Next is the main part which will be the (<)body(>) (also needs to be closed) and where all actual content of your doc will show up.
<br><br>
Finally last thing is that computers are stupid and must be told exactly how to figure things out with the code above and that programmers are not expected to remember everything and to use any availible resources out there to help as you code.
